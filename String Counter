You must have seen that in a doc, when you try to find a word by the inbuilt function, it also tells the number of time it occured.
The following code does the same.
String refers to the complete doc, and sub_string refers to the word or sequence, which we want to search in the doc.

def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    counter,sum = 0,0
    for _ in range(0, len(string)):
        if matcher(string[counter:(len(sub_string)+counter)], sub_string):
            sum = sum + 1
        counter=counter + 1
    return sum

def matcher(sliced_str, sub_string):
    return sliced_str == sub_string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    string = input().strip()
    sub_string = input().strip()
    
    count = count_substring(string, sub_string)
    print(count)
